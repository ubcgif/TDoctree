Here, the program libraries for tdoctree v2 will be used to:

    - create an Octree mesh based on the survey
    - create octree models
    - predict TEM data for a synthetic model
    - create interface weights
    - invert TEM data created using our synthetic model


.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2

    Create octree mesh <example/create_octree>
    Create octree model <example/create_model>
    Forward modeling <example/fwd>
    Create interface weights <example/create_weights>
    Inversion <example/inv>
