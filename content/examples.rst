Here, the program libraries for tdoctree tiled package will be used to:

    - create an Octree mesh based on the survey
    - create octree models
    - predict TEM data for a synthetic model
    - invert TEM data created using our synthetic model

Zip folders containing all necessary files can be downloaded here:
