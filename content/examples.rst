Examples
========

Here, the program libraries for E3D version 1 will be used to:

    - create an Octree mesh based on the survey
    - create octree models
    - predict FEM data for a synthetic model
    - create interface weights
    - invert FEM data created using our synthetic model

Zip folders containing all necessary files can be downloaded here:

    - `Files for example using E3D version 1 <https://github.com/ubcgif/E3D/raw/e3dinv/assets/e3d_ver1_example.zip>`__

The full examples are parse into 4 sections:
